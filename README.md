My good friend Bob gave me a little LoRa device loaded with Meshtastic software.

The device is the Heltec htit-wb32laf

Bob made a nice little box for it.

Someday I may become interested enough to play with it. That probably won't be for a while.

I got the PDF from https://resource.heltec.cn/download/WiFi_LoRa_32_V3/HTIT-WB32LA_V3(Rev1.1).pdf
